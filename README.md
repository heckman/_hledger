A zsh completion script for [hledger](https://hledger.org/)

Taken from [https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-completions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-completions).

It has at least one annoying issue that I'm going to take a stab at mending.
Namely, the `import` subcommand does not expect to be followed by a file name.

I'd fork repo I got it from, but I don't know what I'm doing as I've never
touched a completion before. If I develop this beyond a hack, maybe I'll
figure out how to contribute it to the project.

In the mean time, this repo is a hacky work in progress
written by someone who doesn't know how completions work.
I'm just fiddling with things until they work for me.
